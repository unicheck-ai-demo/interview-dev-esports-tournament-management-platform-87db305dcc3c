# Django Interview

Welcome to the live‑coding stage of our hiring process.
You will work on a compact yet production‑style Django REST project. Issues reported by product, marketing, and finance have been turned into auto-tests.

**Your goal is to address those issues and keep all tests green.**

### What's included

- A ready‑to‑run Django application.
- Pre‑configured infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, devcontainer).
- A comprehensive test suite. All tests should stay green.

## Business stories to address

[See the task list](docs/tasks.md)

## Requirements
- All tests must be successfully passed. For `tests/interview/`, the removal of the decorator `@pytest.mark.xfail` is mandatory.
- Your solution will be evaluated externally. In addition to test results, the following aspects will be considered:
    - code quality and style
    - architectural and implementation decisions
    - adherence to industry best practices
    - the amount of time invested in completing the task
- Creative solutions are welcome if they meet quality standards.

### ⏱ Time‑box

The task is designed to be solved not more than **1 hour**. Focus on clear, incremental fixes.
One hour after the start, access to the interview will be closed.

### Helpful commands

Use the terminal to run:

- `make interview` to run interview tests to check your solutions.
- `make test` to run common project tests to ensure that common features are still working.
- `make lint` to run linters and formatters.
- see more useful commands in the `Makefile`.

Good luck and enjoy!
